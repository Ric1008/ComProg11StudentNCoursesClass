# ComProg11StudentNCoursesClass
 Class describing students and courses.  Initial analysis seems to indicate that this is to teach us how to have a Class be used inside another class which is the one we will be using.  Also how to properly use Arraylists.  The only hitch is that the link to the Arraylist Javadoc doesn't work.  I will have to hope that what I found on the internet is correct.
